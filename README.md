This repository contains a set of PowerShell scripts designed to automate an outdoor movie night experience.
They handle playlist creation, video playback, lighting controls, intermissions, and video formatting for consistent display.

## üìÇ Files Overview

### 1. `_OutsideMovieNightScript.ps1`
Main automation script for running the movie night.

- **Lighting Control Hooks**
  - `$CurlRun1`, `$CurlRun2`, `$CurlRun3Option1`, `$CurlRun3Option2` are placeholders for Home Assistant (or other smart lighting) webhooks.
  - They can be defined in `Variables.ps1` to control lights before, during, and after movies.

- **Variable Loading**
  - Loads external settings from `Variables.ps1`.

- **Window Management**
  - Minimizes all windows before playback using `Shell.Application`.

- **Movie & Clip Selection**
  - Reads lists of intro, intermission, and end clips from text files.
  - Randomly selects one clip from each category if available.
  - Builds a playlist with:
    - An intro clip (optional)
    - The main movie
    - Either an intermission clip or end clip depending on movie position

- **Media Player Integration**
  - Launches `mpc-hc64` with a playlist in fullscreen mode.
  - Calculates total playlist duration by reading metadata from the files.
  - Adjusts sleep timers with an offset (`$MovieTimeOffSet`) to trigger lighting events before playback ends.
  - Waits for MPC-HC to fully exit before continuing.

- **Intermission Handling**
  - Optionally plays a Marine Aquarium screensaver between movies.
  - Runs `$CurlRun3` (lighting control) at intermission or final movie.

- **Error Handling**
  - Displays error messages if a movie fails to load or process.
  - Pauses for user input if a fatal error occurs.

- **Shutdown Option**
  - If `$EndOfNightShutDown` is set, the system shuts down after the last movie.

### 2. `Variables.ps1`
Central configuration file for the movie night scripts.

- **Folder Paths**
  - `$rootFolder` ‚Üí Main directory (`D:\MovieNight`)
  - `$movieFolder` ‚Üí Movies folder
  - `$clipsFolder` ‚Üí Clips folder
  - Paths for text lists: `MovieList.txt`, `_IntroClips.txt`, `_IntermissionClips.txt`, `_EndClips.txt`

- **Playback Timing**
  - `$MovieTimeOffSet` ‚Üí Time (in seconds) before movie end to trigger `$CurlRun2`
  - `$Intermission` ‚Üí Duration of intermission (in seconds)

- **Optional Shutdown**
  - `$EndOfNightShutDown` can be uncommented to enable auto-shutdown after all movies.

- **Lighting Controls**
  - Example curl webhooks are provided for integration with Home Assistant:
    - `$CurlRun1` ‚Üí Pre-movie lighting
    - `$CurlRun2` ‚Üí Post-movie lighting
    - `$CurlRun3Option1` ‚Üí End-of-night lights off
    - `$CurlRun3Option2` ‚Üí Intermission lights

### 3. `MovieList.txt`
These are plain text files that define the playlist content for the movie night. Each file should list one filename per line.

- **`MovieList.txt`** ‚Üí The main list of movies to be played in order. *(Required: file must exist and contain at least one entry)*

---

### 4. `_IntroClips.txt`, `_IntermissionClips.txt`, `_EndClips.txt`
These are plain text files that define the playlist content for the movie night. Each file should list one filename per line.

- **`_IntroClips.txt`** ‚Üí A list of optional intro clips shown before each movie. *(Required as a text file, but video entries inside are optional)*
- **`_IntermissionClips.txt`** ‚Üí A list of optional intermission clips shown between movies. *(Required as a text file, but video entries inside are optional)*
- **`_EndClips.txt`** ‚Üí A list of optional closing clips shown after the final movie. *(Required as a text file, but video entries inside are optional)*

‚ö†Ô∏è Even if you don‚Äôt plan to use intro, intermission, or end clips, the corresponding text files must still exist (they can be empty).

### 5. `_VideoFormat.ps1`
Script to generate a **display format reference** for all listed movies.
This script is **optional** and primarily assists with **projector aiming and screen setup** before movie night.

- **Dependencies**
  - Loads paths from `Variables.ps1`.
  - Uses `mpc-hc64` for video playback and screenshots.
  - Requires `System.Windows.Forms` and `System.Drawing`.

- **Process**
  1. Reads `MovieList.txt` for all movies.
  2. Opens each movie in MPC-HC and saves a screenshot.
  3. Analyzes image dimensions to calculate max scaled size that fits within a 1920x1080 box.
  4. Generates a reference image (`_DisplayFormat.png`) with red/green borders showing safe display dimensions.
  5. Deletes temporary screenshots after processing.

- **Use Case**
  - Ensures all movies display properly on the screen without uneven scaling or cropping.
  - Provides a **visual guide** to help align the projector and verify aspect ratio before starting the event.
